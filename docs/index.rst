Common Interfaces and Factories for Identifiers
===============================================

.. contents::

Abstract
========

This specification defines common interfaces for representing and creating
identifiers in PHP. Identifiers are names that identify specific objects or
types of objects. Software engineers have defined many different identifiers
based on a variety of needs, such as uniqueness, authority, and scalability.
Some popular identifiers defined as a result of these efforts include [UUID]_,
[ULID]_, and [Snowflake]_ identifiers.

Final implementations MAY decorate identifiers with more functionality than
proposed here, but they MUST implement the indicated interfaces/functionality
described in this document.

Introduction
============

As programmers, we use identifiers everywhere. Without them, we wouldn't be able
to keep track of, for example, a user's account or the location of a web page.
To identify a user's account, we might use an auto-incrementing integer created
by a database; for a web page, we might use a URL. Both can uniquely identify
the object they refer to, based on their context---within a specific database
table, the user's identifier can refer only to them, and on the web, a URL can
refer only to a single web page.

Identifiers come in many forms. We've mentioned two such forms: integers and
strings. Within these forms, identifiers might have metadata embedded within
them. From the URL, we can assume that it resolves to some information stored
on the web; we can determine the protocol, host name, and port number used to
access this information. Depending on the combination of characters in the URL,
we might also be able to determine the expected language of the information
(e.g., if the URL includes a path segment like ``/en-US/``) or the title of the
page or the date of the article, if the URL includes this information in a
human-readable form. On the other hand, the user's account identifier might not
include any obvious metadata at all. It is a simple integer, with no context.

We can decipher information from the URL because there is a specification for
how to form them. Other data included in URLs might be intuited from context
clues---if part of the URL appears to have a formatted date-time string, then
that date is likely related to the content at that URL, in some way.

Other types of identifiers might include non-obvious metadata that we can only
decipher if we know how they were created. If we know the user's account
identifier is a [Snowflake]_, then we know we can extract the time it was
created and possibly other information, such as the machine or worker that
created it.

Most identifiers share a handful of common traits, and we tend to use them
similarly, despite how different they might appear on the surface. We might
compare them for equality or sorting. We might convert them to a binary
representation for storage or extract the date to find when they were created.
This specification attempts to capture these commonalities, providing
applications and libraries a means to create and pass identifiers, without being
locked-in to a specific implementation.

Terminology
===========

Requirements Language
---------------------

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119]_ [RFC8174]_
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

Definitions
-----------

Binary
    A base-2 numeral system, where each position has a value of either zero (0)
    or one (1), also known as a *bit*. In the context of this specification,
    binary data refers to a byte string.

Byte string
    A sequence of bytes in which each byte is a sequence of 8 bits, with 256
    possible values. A byte string is sometimes referred to as an *octet stream*.

Date-time
    A representation of a point in history as a date and time, usually using an
    instance of ``\DateTimeInterface`` in PHP.

Identifier
    "[A] name that identifies (that is, labels the identity of) either a unique
    object or a unique class of objects, where the 'object' or class may be an
    idea, physical countable object (or class thereof), or physical noncountable
    substance (or class thereof)" [Wikipedia]_.

Usage
=====

Creating Identifiers
--------------------

Applications SHOULD use factories to create identifiers, wherever possible.

.. code-block:: php

    $identifier = $factory->create();

Sorting Identifiers
-------------------

This specification supports in-application sorting of identifiers. For example:

.. code-block:: php

    usort($identifiers, fn (Identifier $a, Identifier $b): int => $a->compareTo($b));

Get the Timestamp
-----------------

``DateTimeIdentifier`` instances support extracting the date-time value from the
identifier. The return value of ``getDateTime()`` is a PHP ``\DateTimeImmutable``
instance.

.. code-block:: php

    $timestamp = $identifier->getDateTime()->getTimestamp();

Interfaces
==========

Identifiers
-----------

Identifier
~~~~~~~~~~

The identifier interface defines the most basic operations all identifiers
support. These basic operations provide the ability to compare identifiers and
convert the identifier to a string for presentation.

To provide comparison, implementations MUST implement ``compareTo()``, which
MUST accept any value for comparison, returning an integer less than, equal to,
or greater than zero, if the identifier is less than, equal to, or greater than
the value. This allows for sorting identifiers.

Likewise, ``equals()`` MUST accept any value for comparison and return boolean
``true`` if the identifier is equal to the value and ``false`` otherwise.

If an implementation wishes to indicate that it cannot compare the identifier
to the provided value, it MUST throw an ``\Identifier\Exception\NotComparable``
exception.

The ``toString()`` method SHOULD return a human-readable representation of the
identifier (e.g., integer string, UUID, hexadecimal-encoded, Base64-encoded,
etc.).

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Identifier;

    interface Identifier
    {
        /**
         * Returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the
         * identifier is less than, equal to, or greater than the other value
         *
         * @throws Exception\NotComparable MUST throw if the implementation is
         *     unable to make comparisons with the other value provided
         */
        public function compareTo(mixed $other): int;

        /**
         * Returns true if the identifier is equal to the other value
         *
         * @throws Exception\NotComparable MUST throw if the implementation is
         *     unable to make comparisons with the other value provided
         */
        public function equals(mixed $other): bool;

        /**
         * Returns a string representation of the identifier
         */
        public function toString(): string;
    }

BytesIdentifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A bytes identifier is an identifier that is based on arbitrary binary data. The
``toBytes()`` method MUST return the byte string representation of the
identifier.

Bytes identifiers are useful especially when the size of the identifier
overflows the system limitations for maximum or minimum integers. For example,
UUIDs and ULIDs, both 128-bit integers, may be represented as bytes identifiers.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Identifier;

    /**
     * An identifier based on arbitrary binary data
     */
    interface BytesIdentifier extends Identifier
    {
        /**
         * Returns the identifier as a raw byte string
         */
        public function toBytes(): string;
    }

DateTimeIdentifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A date-time identifier is based on a date-time value or otherwise has a
date-time value associated with it that may be extracted from the identifier.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Identifier;

    interface DateTimeIdentifier extends Identifier
    {
        /**
         * Returns a date-time representation of the timestamp associated with
         * this identifier
         */
        public function getDateTime(): \DateTimeImmutable;
    }

IntegerIdentifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integer identifiers are identifiers that may be represented as integers.

Implementations MAY support identifiers greater than ``PHP_INT_MAX`` and less
than ``PHP_INT_MIN``. In this case, the ``toInteger()`` method SHOULD return a
string value. If the return value is a string, it MUST be a numeric string.

If an implementation does not support identifiers greater than ``PHP_INT_MAX``
or less than ``PHP_INT_MIN``, and the ``toInteger()`` operation attempts to
return an integer outside these boundaries, it MUST throw an
``\Identifier\Exception\OutOfRange`` exception.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Identifier;

    interface IntegerIdentifier extends Identifier
    {
        /**
         * Returns an integer representation of the identifier
         *
         * @return int | numeric-string
         *
         * @throws Exception\OutOfRange MUST throw if the implementation does
         *     not support integers outside the range of PHP_INT_MIN and
         *     PHP_INT_MAX and the identifier evaluates to an integer outside
         *     this range
         */
        public function toInteger(): int | string;
    }

Identifier Factories
--------------------

IdentifierFactory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``IdentifierFactory`` defines a common interface for factories that create
identifiers.

Descendants of ``IdentifierFactory`` MAY specify a narrower return type for the
``create()`` method.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Identifier;

    interface IdentifierFactory
    {
        /**
         * Creates a new instance of an identifier
         */
        public function create(): Identifier;
    }

BytesIdentifierFactory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``BytesIdentifierFactory`` defines a common interface for factories that create
identifiers from raw byte strings.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Identifier;

    /**
     * Creates identifiers based on arbitrary binary data
     */
    interface BytesIdentifierFactory extends IdentifierFactory
    {
        public function create(): BytesIdentifier;

        /**
         * Creates a new instance of an identifier from the given byte string
         * representation
         *
         * @param string $identifier A binary octet string encoded according to
         *     the specification for the type of identifier
         *
         * @throws Exception\InvalidArgument MUST throw if $identifier is not a
         *     legal value
         */
        public function createFromBytes(string $identifier): BytesIdentifier;
    }

DateTimeIdentifierFactory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``DateTimeIdentifierFactory`` defines a common interface for factories that
create identifiers from date-time values.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Identifier;

    interface DateTimeIdentifierFactory extends IdentifierFactory
    {
        public function create(): DateTimeIdentifier;

        /**
         * Creates a new instance of an identifier from the given date-time
         *
         * @param \DateTimeInterface $dateTime The date-time to use when
         *     creating the identifier
         *
         * @throws Exception\InvalidArgument MUST throw if $dateTime is not a
         *     legal value
         */
        public function createFromDateTime(\DateTimeInterface $dateTime): DateTimeIdentifier;
    }

IntegerIdentifierFactory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``IntegerIdentifierFactory`` defines a common interface for factories that
create identifiers from integers.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Identifier;

    interface IntegerIdentifierFactory extends IdentifierFactory
    {
        public function create(): IntegerIdentifier;

        /**
         * Creates a new instance of an identifier from the given integer
         * representation
         *
         * @param int | numeric-string $identifier
         *
         * @throws Exception\InvalidArgument MUST throw if the identifier is not
         *     a legal value
         * @throws Exception\OutOfRange MUST throw if the implementation does
         *     not support integers outside the range of PHP_INT_MIN and
         *     PHP_INT_MAX and the identifier evaluates to an integer outside
         *     this range
         */
        public function createFromInteger(int | string $identifier): IntegerIdentifier;
    }

StringIdentifierFactory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``StringIdentifierFactory`` defines a common interface for factories that
create identifiers from strings.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Identifier;

    interface StringIdentifierFactory extends IdentifierFactory
    {
        /**
         * Creates a new instance of an identifier from the given string
         * representation
         *
         * @param string $identifier The string representation of the identifier
         *     is specific to the type of identifier and implementation; for
         *     example, UUIDs use a specific format, while other identifiers may
         *     use other formats
         *
         * @throws Exception\InvalidArgument MUST throw if the identifier is not
         *     a legal value
         */
        public function createFromString(string $identifier): Identifier;
    }

Exceptions
----------

IdentifierException
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a base exception from which all identifier exceptions descend. If an
implementation uses custom exception types, they MAY implement this interface.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Identifier\Exception;

    /**
     * Base interface representing generic exceptions for identifiers
     */
    interface IdentifierException extends \Throwable
    {
    }

InvalidArgument
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Identifier factory methods that accept arguments MUST throw ``InvalidArgument``
exceptions if any of the arguments are not legal values for the method.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Identifier\Exception;

    /**
     * The argument passed is invalid
     */
    interface InvalidArgument extends IdentifierException
    {
    }

NotComparable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an implementation cannot or chooses not to compare a given value to an
identifier (through ``Identifier::compareTo()`` or ``Identifier::equals()``), it
MUST throw a ``NotComparable`` exception.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Identifier\Exception;

    /**
     * The given value cannot be compared to the identifier
     */
    interface NotComparable extends IdentifierException
    {
    }

OutOfRange
~~~~~~~~~~

If an implementation does not support integer values outside the range
*[ PHP_INT_MIN .. PHP_INT_MAX ]*, it MUST throw an ``OutOfRange`` exception when
encountering integers outside this range as input arguments to
``IntegerIdentifierFactory::createFromInteger()`` or when evaluating return
values for ``IntegerIdentifier::toInteger()``.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Identifier\Exception;

    /**
     * The value is out of the range of acceptable values
     */
    interface OutOfRange extends IdentifierException
    {
    }
